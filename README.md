Detection of wooden mussel rafts using Sentinel 2 images.
Graphical application under matlab.
Put all sentinel images (layers) in the same folder.
Name them as the folder with the usual sufix (_B01.jp2...).
Rename band 8A as 13.
Result will appear in a separate figure, rafts are the yellow points.
Main window wil display the RGB composition of original image.
Better running on a cropped version. Be careful to crop at "equivalent" points,
taking into account different resolutions.
Four example images provided (all from Galicia, Spain).
Each example folder contains a file with the coordinates of cropping points
(for 10m resolution).
